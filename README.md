# TC_Notes
As the transcorrelated (TC) workflow is now quite complicated and full of optional parameters, this note summarizes my experience with the TC framework.

- The workflow of TC is briefly described in the file `TC_workflow.md`.
- The scripts for running TC are in the folder `scripts` (One should install `PySCF/Molpro`,`CASINO`,`PYTCHINT`,`ElemCo.jl/NECI/Block2/...` before using scripts used to call these programs)

#### TODO
- Multi-determinant Jastrow optimization and usage of pseudo-potential in TC_workflow
- Introduction of Step 4 in `TC_workflow.md`
